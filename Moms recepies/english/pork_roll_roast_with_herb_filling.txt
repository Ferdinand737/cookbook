Pork Roll Roast with Herb Filling and Vegetables (Brigitte)
(Clay Pot)

1 kg pork roll roast
Pepper
50 g bacon
1 onion, 1 bunch parsley
Thyme
2 zucchini à about 200 g
3 tbsp crème fraîche
500 g green beans
2 garlic cloves
Rosemary
500 g tomatoes
Fresh thyme

Unfold meat. Season with salt and pepper. For filling, cut bacon into fine strips and slowly render at low heat. Add onion cubes and sauté until translucent. Add chopped parsley, dried thyme, one coarsely grated zucchini and 1 crème fraîche and stir. Season with salt and pepper. Spread bacon-vegetable filling on meat. Roll meat up tightly again and tie together. Put cleaned beans, remaining zucchini cut into slices, peeled garlic cloves and rosemary in clay pot. Place roll roast on top. Put on soaked lid. Put pot in cold oven. Cook at 220°C (convection 190) for 1 h 30 min (rather 2 h). Add tomato quarters and thyme sprigs to pot. Add remaining crème fraîche to vegetables. Continue roasting without lid for 15 min.
