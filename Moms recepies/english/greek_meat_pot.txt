Greek Meat Pot

500 g lamb or mutton or pork
Salt, pepper, thyme
4 tbsp oil
2 garlic cloves
1 bay leaf
1 small cinnamon stick
1-2 eggplants
1-2 zucchini
2 bell peppers
4 onions
2-3 potatoes
4 tomatoes
Juice of 1 lemon
2 tbsp tomato paste
1/8 l water
Broth
Parsley

Rinse and dry meat. Cut into 2 cm cubes. Sprinkle meat cubes with spices and mix well by hand. Heat oil in pot and brown meat for 8-10 minutes. Add peeled and crushed garlic cloves, bay leaf and cinnamon, close pot and braise meat for 10 min. Meanwhile prepare vegetables. Wash eggplants, zucchini and cored bell peppers and drain. Cut all into 1Â½ cm pieces or slices, peel and quarter tomatoes.

Push meat to center of pot and arrange vegetables as outer ring - preferably separated by type.

In a small bowl, mix lemon juice, tomato paste, water, instant broth and parsley. Pour over vegetables, bring to boil, then close pot and turn to lowest heat. Braise for 20-25 minutes until tender.

For clay pot preparation, use oven for cooking. Brown and pre-cook meat in pan. Then put in clay pot. Arrange vegetables as outer ring and pour broth over. Cook in oven for 60 min.
