Nördlingen Tomato Soup (serves 4)

Ingredients:
- 10–12 tomatoes
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2–4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 400 g ground beef
- 2 tbsp flour
- 1/2 tsp sambal oelek
- Salt, ground pepper, grated nutmeg
- Dried herbs: oregano, basil, rosemary, lovage
- 1 tbsp oil (rapeseed, olive, or sunflower)
- 4–5 tbsp dark Chinese soy sauce
- 1/8–1/4 liter dry red wine
- 4 cl dry sherry

Preparation:
1) Soften the onion in hot oil until translucent. Dust with flour, cook while stirring until lightly golden, then deglaze with the sherry.
2) Peel the tomatoes, quarter them, add to the pot, and let simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until reduced a bit.
3) Season well with the spices and herbs. Add a little water from time to time as needed until a lightly creamy consistency is reached.
4) Add the ground beef; after about 10 minutes of cooking, taste and adjust seasoning.
5) Add the garlic and red wine, simmer another 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the cream.

Tip: Serve with baguette or ciabatta and a French or Italian red wine.
