Flammkuchen with Cream

Ingredients
Dough:
- 375 g flour
- 20 g yeast
- 1/8–1/4 liter lukewarm water
- Salt
- 2 tbsp oil

Topping:
- 2 cups schmand (or sour cream/crème fraîche)
- 100 g grated Emmental

Preparation
1) Make a yeast dough from the dough ingredients and let it rise, covered, in a warm place for 30 minutes.
2) Stir the schmand with the cheese and season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
3) Slice the onions into thin rings. Render the bacon in a pan, add the onions, and sauté until translucent.
4) Knead the dough again and roll it out on a large greased baking sheet.
5) Spread the sour-cream-and-cheese mixture over the dough, then distribute the onion–bacon mixture on top.
6) Bake in a preheated oven at about 230°C (450°F) for roughly 10 minutes.
