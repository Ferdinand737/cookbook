Spinach Calzone

Dough: Filling:
500g flour 1kg spinach
30g (1 cube yeast) 1 onion
125ml lukewarm water 2 garlic cloves
1 tsp salt 4 tbsp olive oil
1 egg 1 tsp salt
2 tbsp oil black pepper
200g cooked ham
100g Fontina or butter cheese
50g black olives
1 tbsp capers
1 egg yolk for brushing

Sift flour into a bowl, make a well in the center, crumble in the yeast, and dissolve with water. Dust the starter with a little flour, cover with a cloth, and let rise in a warm place for about 15 minutes. Add salt, egg, and oil and knead into a smooth yeast dough. Cover and let rise again for 15-20 minutes.

Remove any tough stems from the spinach and wash. Cook in salted water for about 5 minutes, then drain well. Let the spinach cool and coarsely chop. Finely chop the onion and press the garlic. Heat the olive oil in a large pan, sauté the onion and garlic until translucent, add the chopped spinach, and season with salt and pepper. Cut the ham and Fontina into small cubes, pit and chop the olives, and mix with the spinach. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to twice the size of a baking sheet. Cover the sheet with one half of the dough, letting the other half overhang. Prick the dough several times with a fork. Spread the spinach filling over the sheet, leaving a strip bare around the edge. Brush this strip with egg yolk, fold over the second half of the dough, and press the edge firmly to seal. Let rest for 10-20 minutes. Brush the calzone with egg yolk and bake in a preheated oven at 220°C for 25-30 minutes.
