Pizza Pockets

Dough:                         Filling:
425 g flour                    200 g cooked ham
½ tsp salt                     250 g broccoli
1 package dry yeast            1 red bell pepper
4 tbsp olive oil               125 g mozzarella

For the dough:
Mix flour with salt and dry yeast. Add oil and a quarter liter of lukewarm water and knead into a smooth dough. Let dough rise in a warm place for about 45 min. Knead vigorously again and divide into eight portions. Roll each piece round (20 cm) on a little flour.

For the filling:
Cut ham into strips. Divide broccoli into florets and boil in salt water for one minute. Drain and rinse cold. Clean, core and cut bell pepper into strips. Dice mozzarella. Mix broccoli, bell pepper and mozzarella, season with salt and pepper. Place some filling on one half of each rolled dough, fold other half over and press edges firmly. Place on baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in preheated oven at 250°C for about 15 min until surface is nicely brown.

Goes well with tzatziki.
