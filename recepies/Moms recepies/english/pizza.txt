Pizza

Dough (inspired by Heidi):

Approximately 250g flour
100g margarine
1 tsp salt
1 tsp vinegar
125ml water

Combine all ingredients and knead, adding flour as needed until a smooth, elastic dough forms that's easy to roll out. Ideally, chill the dough for a while to improve its texture.

Topping:

Make a sauce from one or two cans of crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, various seasonings, and garlic paste. Spread this sauce over the rolled-out dough, then add toppings like salami, anchovies, or your favorites.
