8 peach halves (canned)
Butter

Soak bread roll in warm water, then squeeze out very well. Add egg, ground meat and seasonings. Process everything into a smooth meat mixture that should be seasoned quite spicily. Form 8 meatballs from the mixture. Prepare 1/2 l meat broth. Place meatballs in boiling broth, then turn heat to lowest setting and let meatballs simmer for 10-12 min. Bring 1/8 l meat broth and 1/8 l water to boil together and stir in curry sauce. Melt butter in pan and heat drained peaches for 3 min. Remove meatballs from broth and place on peach halves. Pour hot curry sauce over and serve.
